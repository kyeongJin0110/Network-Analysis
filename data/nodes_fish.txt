fish
are
gill
bearing
aquatic
craniate
animals
that
lack
limbs
with
digits
they
form
a
sister
group
to
the
tunicates
together
forming
the
olfactores
included
in
this
definition
are
the
living
hagfish
lampreys
and
cartilaginous
and
bony
fish
as
well
as
various
extinct
related
groups
the
earliest
organisms
that
can
be
classified
as
fish
were
soft
bodied
chordates
that
first
appeared
during
the
cambrian
period
although
they
lacked
a
true
spine
they
possessed
notochords
which
allowed
them
to
be
more
agile
than
their
invertebrate
counterparts
fish
would
continue
to
evolve
through
the
paleozoic
era
diversifying
into
a
wide
variety
of
forms
many
fish
of
the
paleozoic
developed
external
armor
that
protected
them
from
predators
the
first
fish
with
jaws
appeared
in
the
silurian
period
after
which
many
such
as
sharks
became
formidable
marine
predators
rather
than
just
the
prey
of
arthropods
most
fish
are
ectothermic
cold
blooded
allowing
their
body
temperatures
to
vary
as
ambient
temperatures
change
though
some
of
the
large
active
swimmers
like
white
shark
and
tuna
can
hold
a
higher
core
temperature
fish
can
communicate
in
their
underwater
environments
through
the
use
of
acoustic
communication
acoustic
communication
in
fish
involves
the
transmission
of
acoustic
signals
from
one
individual
of
a
species
to
another
the
production
of
sounds
as
a
means
of
communication
among
fish
is
most
often
used
in
the
context
of
feeding
aggression
or
courtship
behaviour
the
sounds
emitted
by
fish
can
vary
depending
on
the
species
and
stimulus
involved
they
can
produce
either
stridulatory
sounds
by
moving
components
of
the
skeletal
system
or
can
produce
non
stridulatory
sounds
by
manipulating
specialized
organs
such
as
the
swimbladder
fish
are
abundant
in
most
bodies
of
water
they
can
be
found
in
nearly
all
aquatic
environments
from
high
mountain
streams
e
g
char
and
gudgeon
to
the
abyssal
and
even
hadal
depths
of
the
deepest
oceans
e
g
cusk
eels
and
snailfish
although
no
species
has
yet
been
documented
in
the
deepest
of
the
ocean
with
described
species
fish
exhibit
greater
species
diversity
than
any
other
group
of
vertebrates
fish
are
an
important
resource
for
humans
worldwide
especially
as
food
commercial
and
subsistence
fishers
hunt
fish
in
wild
fisheries
or
farm
them
in
ponds
or
in
cages
in
the
ocean
in
aquaculture
they
are
also
caught
by
recreational
fishers
kept
as
pets
raised
by
fishkeepers
and
exhibited
in
public
aquaria
fish
have
had
a
role
in
culture
through
the
ages
serving
as
deities
religious
symbols
and
as
the
subjects
of
art
books
and
movies
tetrapods
emerged
within
lobe
finned
fishes
so
cladistically
they
are
fish
as
well
however
traditionally
fish
are
rendered
paraphyletic
by
excluding
the
tetrapods
i
e
the
amphibians
reptiles
birds
and
mammals
which
all
descended
from
within
the
same
ancestry
because
in
this
manner
the
term
fish
is
defined
negatively
as
a
paraphyletic
group
it
is
not
considered
a
formal
taxonomic
grouping
in
systematic
biology
unless
it
is
used
in
the
cladistic
sense
including
tetrapods
the
traditional
term
pisces
also
ichthyes
is
considered
a
typological
but
not
a
phylogenetic
classification
