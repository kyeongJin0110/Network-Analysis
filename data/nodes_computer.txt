a
computer
is
a
machine
that
can
be
instructed
to
carry
out
sequences
of
arithmetic
or
logical
operations
automatically
via
computer
programming
modern
computers
have
the
ability
to
follow
generalized
sets
of
operations
called
programs
these
programs
enable
computers
to
perform
an
extremely
wide
range
of
tasks
a
complete
computer
including
the
hardware
the
operating
system
main
software
and
peripheral
equipment
required
and
used
for
full
operation
can
be
referred
to
as
a
computer
system
this
term
may
as
well
be
used
for
a
group
of
computers
that
are
connected
and
work
together
in
particular
a
computer
network
or
computer
cluster
computers
are
used
as
control
systems
for
a
wide
variety
of
industrial
and
consumer
devices
this
includes
simple
special
purpose
devices
like
microwave
ovens
and
remote
controls
factory
devices
such
as
industrial
robots
and
computer
aided
design
and
also
general
purpose
devices
like
personal
computers
and
mobile
devices
such
as
smartphones
the
internet
is
run
on
computers
and
it
connects
hundreds
of
millions
of
other
computers
and
their
users
early
computers
were
only
conceived
as
calculating
devices
since
ancient
times
simple
manual
devices
like
the
abacus
aided
people
in
doing
calculations
early
in
the
industrial
revolution
some
mechanical
devices
were
built
to
automate
long
tedious
tasks
such
as
guiding
patterns
for
looms
more
sophisticated
electrical
machines
did
specialized
analog
calculations
in
the
early
th
century
the
first
digital
electronic
calculating
machines
were
developed
during
world
war
ii
the
first
semiconductor
transistors
in
the
late
s
were
followed
by
the
silicon
based
mosfet
mos
transistor
and
monolithic
integrated
circuit
ic
chip
technologies
in
the
late
s
leading
to
the
microprocessor
and
the
microcomputer
revolution
in
the
s
the
speed
power
and
versatility
of
computers
have
been
increasing
dramatically
ever
since
then
with
mos
transistor
counts
increasing
at
a
rapid
pace
as
predicted
by
moore
s
law
leading
to
the
digital
revolution
during
the
late
th
to
early
st
centuries
conventionally
a
modern
computer
consists
of
at
least
one
processing
element
typically
a
central
processing
unit
cpu
in
the
form
of
a
metal
oxide
semiconductor
mos
microprocessor
along
with
some
type
of
computer
memory
typically
mos
semiconductor
memory
chips
the
processing
element
carries
out
arithmetic
and
logical
operations
and
a
sequencing
and
control
unit
can
change
the
order
of
operations
in
response
to
stored
information
peripheral
devices
include
input
devices
keyboards
mice
joystick
etc
output
devices
monitor
screens
printers
etc
and
input
output
devices
that
perform
both
functions
e
g
the
s
era
touchscreen
peripheral
devices
allow
information
to
be
retrieved
from
an
external
source
and
they
enable
the
result
of
operations
to
be
saved
and
retrieved
